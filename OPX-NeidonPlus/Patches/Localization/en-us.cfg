		// Nito
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nito_Name = Nito^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nito_Desc = Nito is one of the smallest moons discovered in the Solar System, embedded within Neidon's rings while also flying somewhat above it. Named after one of Neidon's twin children, it is the closest of the planet's moons and barely held together by tensile strength due to orbiting within the Roche limit.

		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nito_Biome_H = Highlands
		
		// Tito
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Tito_Name = Tito^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Tito_Desc = Tito is Nito's more temperate twin sister. Orbiting closer to the rings in lockstep with Nito helps it to keep it steadier in the long run, although it still bobbles a bit like a buoy. Not that there's anything wrong with it-- just a bit more boring overall.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Tito_Biome_ER = Equatorial Ridge
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Tito_Biome_L = Lowlands

		// Gryspar
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gryspar_Name = Gryspar^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gryspar_Desc = Gryspar is the innermost major moon of Neidon, for a given value of "major". Its orbit is stabilized by a 3:2 resonance with its sister moon Chymere, orbiting just above the planet's sparse ring system. Gryspar's surface is dark and rugged, preventing Kerbin-based telescopes from learning much about it from afar.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gryspar_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gryspar_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gryspar_Biome_H = Highlands

		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gryspar_Biome_C = Craters
		
		// Hargaladh
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Hargaladh_Name = Hargala√∞^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Hargaladh_Desc = It's pronounced HARG-uh-LAWDH. And that's the only thing we really know about it.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Hargaladh_Biome_A = Amphitheatre
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Hargaladh_Biome_Pi = Pits

		// Chymere
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Chymere_Name = Chymere^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Chymere_Desc = Chymere is the second-largest of Neidon's moons, although its discovery was rather recent due to being drowned out by the glare of Neidon and Thatmo. Light-curve analysis reveals that it is irregular despite its huge size--either it has a huge crater on its surface or it's just really ugly. For some reason, it has become the subject of many astronomy-related knock-knock jokes.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Chymere_Biome_VC = Vader Crater

		#LOC_OPX-NP_Thatmo_Biome_L = Lowlands
		
		// Nissee
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nissee_Desc = Nissee is a small yet bright moon in a highly inclined, eccentric orbit around Neidon, and the most distant known moon up until recently. Spectral analysis reveals that its surface is similar in composition to marble, making it not only an enigma of a moon but also the envy of every sculptor on Kerbin.
		
		// Nyla
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nyla_Name = Nyla^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nyla_Desc = Along with its companion, Psei, Nyla is by far the most distantly orbiting moon of any object in the Kerbolar System. It orbits almost as far away as Moho from Kerbol, only holding on by dint of Kerbol's tenuous hold over Neidon. Nyla's orbit is very long, but its low albedo and small size mean that that is about all we can tell about it. Come visit and find out more!
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nyla_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nyla_Biome_Mi = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nyla_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Nyla_Biome_Mo = Mountains
		
		// Psei
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Psei_Name = Psei^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Psei_Desc = Psei is the smaller companion of Nyla, although its much brighter surface likely led to it technically being discovered first. Psei is also much more rugged on its surface than Nyla is, so be careful if you come by. 
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Psei_Biome_IC = Impact Craters
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Psei_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Psei_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Psei_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Psei_Biome_EC = Ektara Crater
		
		// Surface biome of all pseudobodies
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Common_Biome_S = Surface
		
		// Gawyn
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gawyn_Name = I1-Gawyn^N
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Gawyn_Desc = This thing's probably a rubble pile, and it orbits near Nito and Tito. So what?
		
		// Laman
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Laman_Name = O3-Laman
		#LOC_OPX-NP_Laman_Desc = O3-Laman is among the outermost satellites of Neidon, second only to the Nyla/Psei binary pair. It lazily wanders through the outer Neidon system on a slow, prograde orbit taking a number of years to make a single revolution. Perhaps you can visit it on your way into the system!
		
		// Surface Sample
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Sample = You look at the samples with your handy-dandy pocket microscope, and find that they are shaped like little diamonds.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Sample = You rub away a thin layer of regolith to find a hard, semi-tough surface underneath.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Sample = Strange... it's so dark and soft. Could potentially be lead dust.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Sample = A dusty layer of tholins covers the rest of the regolith, though it also appears more or less undisturbed by other things.
		
		// Crew Report
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Neidon_Crew = Why do the rings look so vibrant from here?
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Crew_Landed = You can see the edge of the moon from the window. And as Tito passes by, it looks spectacular.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Crew_Space = Flying through the rings just looks crazy somewhat, especially on the surface of a moon like this.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Crew_Landed = Out the window it's overwhelmingly purple. On the other side, it's just black.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Crew_Space = Right now you look at a dark, dark moon. It's strange, isn't it?
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Crew_Landed = You might get dizzy as this little moonlet tumbles around...
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Crew_Space = You wonder how you're in orbit of such a small little specimen.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Crew = Neidon is a gleaming amethyst in the sky, and Thatmo its pearl companion...
		
		// EVA Report
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Neidon_EVA = The rings here are spectacular at angles like these...
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_EVA_Landed = By Jool, this is beautiful.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_EVA_Space = 
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_EVA_Landed = It's quite interesting to see the brightness to the left and the right of you.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_EVA_Space = It's surrounded by rings and a moon slightly inward... as it passes by, wow.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_EVA_Landed1 = You feel the urge to jump into one of the craters, but then you realize you could jump into orbit instead.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_EVA_Landed2 = There is no reasonable explanation for how terrifying this must be.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_EVA_Space = The moon almost blends in with the space beneath it--no wonder we couldn't get there for so long.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_EVA = Outside, you feel like the Kraken is staring you right in the face.
		
		// Mystery Goo
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Goo_Landed = The goo has shaped itself into an octahedron.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Goo_Space = The goo gets cracked and crumbled.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Goo_Landed = The goo is now a cube. A goobe, if you will.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Goo_Space = The goo is getting a little smooth now.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Goo_Landed = The goo is boiling, freezing, and melting at the same time. And ionizing, to boot.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Goo_Space = The goo is not enjoying its time here, acting skittish even.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Goo = 
		
		// Mobile Materials Lab
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Neidon_Lab = Studying the reflections of the rings, they appear to be made of carbon monoxide and water ice.
		
		// Temperature
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Temp = While the Neidonshine certainly affects the temperature readings somewhat, it certainly feels like a cold place.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Temp_Space = While the Neidonshine certainly affects the temperature readings somewhat, it certainly feels like a cold place.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Temp_Landed = The dark surface keeps it a little warmer than its twin, but given its distance from the Sun it doesn't affect that much.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargalagh_Temp = You've got a cold, dead rock.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Temp = 
		
		// Barometer
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Bar = The only atmosphere around it is aesthetic beauty.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Bar = No pressure here. Besides the stress of space.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Bar = What's the number for room service again?
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Bar_Space = The instrument reads close to zero. It's as if it were in a near-vacuum!
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Bar_Landed = A thin exosphere seems to be pooling near the basins, but otherwise there is nothing.
		
		// Gravity
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Grav_Space = The microgravity here is palpable. You can easily hover here forever.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Grav_Landed = It's barely being held together by tensile strength within the rings.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Grav_Space = The gravity is slight, but there. The ridge appears to be a clue as to why.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Grav_Landed = It's strange how well this is holding together... but also not.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Grav = Neidon pulls on your ship more than this... thing does.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Grav_SpaceH = Chymere appears to be denser than its size would suggest... perhaps the giant collision stripped its crust off and left a bare mantle.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Grav_SpaceL = You can detect little shifts in the gravity field as you pass over everything, suggesting that it may not be fully differentiated.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Grav_Landed = High gravity is definitely expected, although on this scale it's unsure how much would have gotten here.
		
		// Seismic
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Seis = As the moon wobbles up and down on the rings, it reads with a tiny bit of stretching that may compound if its resonance with Tito is not kept.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Seis = There is some slight tension as the moon orbits around, but not nearly as much as Nito must have.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Seis = The readings seem strange. Something could be there, but it could be just the torque from Chymere and Neidon's tidal forces spinning it up.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Seis = The world seems geologically dead for now. Any little readings can be attributed to light and shadow on the surface.
		
		// Magnetic
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Nito_Mag = No magnetism here.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Tito_Mag = You'd get better readings from a fridge magnet.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Mag_Space = You might sense something here, but you're not sure what.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Hargaladh_Mag_Landed = Wow. The magnetism here is intense. It must be a core fragment of some sort, possibly from Chymere or Thatmo.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Mag_Space = Subtle hints of a magnetic field permeate the magnetometer's readings. There could be a little bit of iron distributed throughout keeping it slightly warm.
		#LOC_OPX-NP_SCI_Chymere_Mag_Landed = Magnetism seems to concentrate more near the giant crater, suggesting that the impact may be somewhat recent and rich in heavy metals.
