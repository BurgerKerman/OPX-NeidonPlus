	@RESULTS
	{
		NitoSrfLanded = You look at the samples with your handy-dandy pocket microscope, and find that they are shaped like little diamonds.
		
		TitoSrfLanded = You rub away a thin layer of regolith to find a hard, semi-tough surface underneath.
		
		HargaladhSrfLanded = Strange... it's so dark and soft. Could potentially be lead dust.
		
		ChymereSrfLanded = A dusty layer of tholins covers the rest of the regolith, though it also appears more or less undisturbed by other things.

		NeidonInSpaceLow = Why do the rings look so vibrant from here?
		
		NitoSrfLanded = You can see the edge of the moon from the window. And as Tito passes by, it looks spectacular.
		NitoInSpace = Flying through the rings just looks crazy somewhat, especially on the surface of a moon like this.
		
		TitoSrfLanded = Out the window it's overwhelmingly purple. The other window, black.
		TitoInSpace = Right now you look at a dark, dark moon. It's strange, isn't it?
		
		HargaladhSrfLanded = You might get dizzy as this little moonlet tumbles around...
		HargaladhInSpace = You wonder how you're in orbit of such a small little specimen.
		
		ChymereSrfLanded = Neidon is a gleaming amethyst in the sky, and Thatmo its pearl companion...

		NitoSrfLanded = Jool, this is beautiful.
		NitoInSpace = 
		
		TitoSrfLanded = It's quite interesting to see the brightness to the left and the right of you.
		TitoInSpace = It's surrounded by rings and a moon slightly inward... as it passes by, wow.
		
		HargaladhSrfLanded = The views of Chymere from here are incredibly fascinating.
		HargaladhSrfLanded = You feel the urge to jump into one of the craters, but then you realize you could jump into orbit instead.
		HargaladhInSpace = The moon almost blends in with the space beneath it--no wonder we couldn't get there for so long.

		Nito = While the Neidonshine certainly affects the temperature readings somewhat, it certainly feels like a cold place.
		
		TitoInSpace = While the Neidonshine certainly affects the temperature readings somewhat, it certainly feels like a cold place.
		TitoSrfLanded = The dark surface keeps it a little warmer than its twin, but given its distance from the Sun it doesn't affect that much.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]

	@RESULTS

		Nito = The only atmosphere around it is aesthetic beauty.
		
		Tito = No pressure here. Besides the stress of space.
		
		Hargaladh = What's the number for room service again?
		
		ChymereInSpace = The instrument reads close to zero. It's as if it were in a near-vacuum!
		ChymereSrfLanded = A thin exosphere seems to be pooling near the basins, but otherwise there is nothing.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NitoInSpace = The microgravity here is palpable. You can easily hover here forever.
		NitoSrfLanded = It's barely being held together by tensile strength within the rings.
		
		TitoInSpace = The gravity is slight, but there. The ridge appears to be a clue as to why.
		TitoSrfLanded = It's strange how well this is holding together... but also not.
		
		Hargaladh = Neidon pulls on your ship more than this... thing does.
		
		ChymereInSpaceHigh = Chymere appears to be denser than its size would suggest... perhaps the giant collision stripped its crust off and left a bare mantle.
		ChymereInSpaceLow = You can detect little shifts in the gravity field as you pass over everything, suggesting that it may not be fully differentiated.
		ChymereSrfLanded = High gravity is definitely expected, although on this scale it's unsure how much would have gotten here.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Nito = As the moon wobbles up and down on the rings, it reads with a tiny bit of stretching that may compound if its resonance with Tito is not kept.
		
		Tito = There is some slight tension as the moon orbits around, but not nearly as much as Nito must have.
		
		Hargaladh = The readings seem strange. Something could be there, but it could be just the torque from Chymere and Neidon's tidal forces spinning it up.
		
		Chymere = The world seems geologically dead. Any little readings can be attributed to light and shadow on the surface.

		Nito = No magnetism here.
		
		Tito = A fridge magnet attracts better than this thing.
		
		HargaladhInSpace = You might sense something here, but you're not sure what.
		HargaladhSrflanded = It seems like nearly nothing nowadays.
		
		ChymereInSpace = Subtle hints of a magnetic field permeate the magnetometer's readings. There could be a little bit of iron distributed throughout keeping it slightly warm.
		ChymereSrfLanded = Magnetism seems to concentrate more near the giant crater, suggesting that the impact may be somewhat recent and rich in heavy metals.
